## Milestone Project 2
### General Purpose & Introduction
Survive is a fun and interactive personality quiz. The premise of the quiz enables to see how they would fair in a zombie apocalypse. Upon starting the game, the user is presented with a finite number of scenarios, questions and answers inside a robust and responsive UI which they must read and navigate through. Once they have completed the quiz, the user is presented with a score which relates them to a popular culture zombie content character.
Based on the topical content of the quiz, I thought it was really important to generate the a creepy/post apocalyptic/uneasy atmosphere. I will explain my user considerations, stories and how I met the user stories inside this document.
