            <p>Welcome to Survive, the decision making quiz where you can test your mettle during the inevitable
                zombie
                apocalypse. Before you play, let's get you acquainted with the rules and game instructions:</p>
            <br>
            <ul class="rules-list">
                <li>You will be presented with 10 zombie apocalypse scenarios and questions.</li>
                <li>For each scenario and question, you will have four options to choose from.</li>
                <li>The options have a score value ranging from 10 to 40. When you select an option, your total score
                    will
                    increase.</li>
                <li>Everytime you select an option, the next scenario will be displayed.</li>
                <li>At the end of the game, your score will be assessed and depending on the score you acheive, we will
                    decide how likely you are to survive.</li>
                <li>When you start the game, some background music will play. You can use the buttons above to mute and play the music as you please.</li>
                <li>If you reload the page for any reason, you will be returned to this screen and you will have to
                    begin
                    again.</li>
