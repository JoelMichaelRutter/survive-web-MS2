        <p>Welcome to Survive, the decision making quiz where you can test your mettle during the inevitable
            zombie
            apocalypse. Before you play, let's get you acquainted with the rules and game instructions:</p>
        <br>
        <ul class="rules-list">
            <li>You will be presented with 10 zombie apocalypse scenarios and questions.</li>
            <li>For each scenario and question, you will have four options to choose from.</li>
            <li>The options have a score value ranging from 10 to 40. When you select an option, your total score
                will
                increase.</li>
            <li>Everytime you select an option, the next scenario will be displayed.</li>
            <li>At the end of the game, your score will be assessed and depending on the score you acheive, we will
                decide how likely you are to survive.</li>
            <li>When you start the game, some background music will play. You can use the buttons above to mute and
                play the music as you please.</li>
            <li>If you reload the page for any reason, you will be returned to this screen and you will have to
                begin
                again.</li>
        </ul>

    brackets introduced.

        <p>Based on your answers, you are a survivor. You are stone cold, ruthless and cautious. We know who we are
            tagging along with during the apocalypse.</p>

        <p>Based on your answers, we think that you are more than likely to survive. Your decision making could
            improve though.</p>
        <p>Whilst we think you can probably survive, you might want to have another go to see if you can beat your

        <p>We hate to break it to you but you don't really seem cut out for the end of the world. Your decision
            making is really lacking. You might want to brush up on that and read some zombie apocalypse survival
            guides.</p>

        <p>Let's be honest now, you might aswell just lie down and accept your fate. Based on your answers, we're
            sure that you are as good as zombified when the time comes.</p>
        <p>Fear not, it isn't the end of the world just yet. Go an brush up on your zombie survival skills and come
